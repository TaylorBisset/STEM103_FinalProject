# Final Project: Social Equity Awareness Program
"""
Description: Develop a program that educates users about influential individuals 
or events related to marginalized communities in history, such as Black, Indigenous, LGBT+. 
Users can learn about notable figures, achievements, 
or historical milestones through an interactive interface.
Here's a great history database offered through the EvCC Library, Gale in Context, 
US HistoryLinks to an external site. 
If you access it off campus, you will may need log in information to use it.

Requirements:
1. Create a database or list of notable figures, events, or milestones related to history.
2. Users can select a category (e.g., Black History, Native or Indigenous History, etc) and explore information.
3. Implement a quiz feature that tests users' knowledge about the selected category.
4. Make the program interactive and engaging
